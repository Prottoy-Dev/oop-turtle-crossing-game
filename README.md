## Turtle Crossing Game
The Turtle Crossing game is a simple yet engaging Python-based arcade game created using the Turtle graphics library. In this game, players control a turtle character that needs to safely cross a busy road filled with moving cars. The objective is to navigate the turtle across the road while avoiding collisions with the cars. The game features increasing levels of difficulty as the player successfully crosses the road.

## Key Features:

Player Control: The player can move the turtle character up and down using the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys, respectively.

Obstacles (Cars): The game includes moving obstacles in the form of cars that traverse the screen horizontally.

Score Tracking: A scoreboard displays the current game level, which increases each time the player successfully crosses the road without colliding with a car.

Speed Adjustment: The game introduces a speed multiplier that gradually increases, making the game more challenging as the player progresses.

Game Over: When the turtle collides with a car, the game ends, and a "Game Over" message is displayed on the screen.

Reset: The player's turtle character is reset to the starting position after successfully crossing the road, and the game level increases.
